Objective:
This project aims to delve into a hotel's booking data to uncover insights behind high cancellation rates.

Data:
The dataset contains 119390 rows and 36 columns with features such as 'customer_type', 'previous_cancellations', 'arrival_date_year', etc.

Methodology:
    Data Cleaning: Initial preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized distributions, correlations, and patterns that might explain cancellations.
    Statistical Analysis: Applied specific tests or methods to confirm the significance of observed patterns.

Key Findings:
The insights which are derived are all included in pdf file.

Visualizations:
The project showcases various graphs like bar charts, pie charts, line charts to visually represent the trends and patterns observed during the analysis.
